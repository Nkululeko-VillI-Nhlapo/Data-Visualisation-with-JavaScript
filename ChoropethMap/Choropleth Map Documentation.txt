Choropleth Visualisation  with Html,Css and JS(d3)
By Nhlapo Nkululeko

The code uses D3.js to fetch, process, and visualize county and education data, creating
 an interactive choropleth map where the color of each county represents the percentage 
 of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher. The map includes interactivity 
 with tooltips displaying detailed information when a county is hovered over.

Here's a high-level description of what each part of the code does:

 Data URLs:
Two URLs are defined to fetch the county and education data, respectively.
Data Variables:
Variables (countyData and educationData) are declared to store the fetched data.

D3 Selections:
D3 is used to select the SVG board (#board) and tooltip (#tooltip) elements.

Draw Map Function:
drawMap function is defined to create the choropleth map.
It binds county data to path elements, using D3's enter/update/exit pattern.
For each county, it sets the path data (d attribute) using D3's geoPath.
Colors are determined based on the education percentage, and data attributes are set for
 interactivity. Mouseover and mouseout events are defined to show/hide a tooltip with 
 county-specific information.

Fetching County Data:
D3's json function is used to fetch county data. The received TopoJSON data is converted 
to GeoJSON format (topojson.feature).The resulting GeoJSON features are stored in the 
countyData variable.

Fetching Education Data:
D3's json function is used again to fetch education data.
The education data is stored in the educationData variable.

Drawing the Map:
After both county and education data are fetched, the drawMap function is called to 
render the choropleth map.

Console Logging:
Some log statements are included to output the fetched data for verification and 
debugging.
