Treemap Visualisation  with Html,Css and JS(d3)
By Nhlapo Nkululeko

TreeMap visualization code combines HTML, CSS (not included), and JavaScript with the 
D3.js library to create an interactive TreeMap visualization of movie data, displaying 
information such as movie names, categories, and revenue values. The TreeMap is designed 
to be visually appealing and responsive to user interactions.

1.Import Libraries:
The code starts by importing the D3.js library, which is a powerful library for creating 
dynamic, interactive data visualizations in the browser.

2.CSS Styling:
The code assumes the existence of CSS styling, especially for elements such as 'tile,' 
which is used for styling the rectangles in the treemap.

3.Data URL and Variables:
3.1 movieDataUrl: Holds the URL of a JSON file containing movie data.

3.2 movieData: Will store the movie data retrieved from the JSON file.
3.3 board and tooltip: D3 selections for the 'board' SVG element and the 'tooltip' div.

4.drawTreeMap Function:
This function is responsible for rendering the TreeMap visualization.
It uses D3's hierarchy and treemap functions to structure and layout the movie data.
The treemap layout is applied to the hierarchy, determining the positioning and size of 
each rectangle in the treemap.The function then selects the leaves (individual movies) 
from the hierarchy.For each movie, it appends a group (<g>) element to the SVG board, 
representing each movie tile. Inside each group, a rectangle (<rect>) is appended for the
 movie, with attributes like width, height, color, and data attributes for tooltip 
 information. A mouseover event listener is added to display a tooltip with information 
 about the movie when the user hovers over it. Similarly, a mouseout event listener is 
 added to hide the tooltip when the user moves the cursor away.
Additionally, text (<text>) is appended within each group to display the name of the 
movie.

5.Loading Data:
The script uses D3's json function to asynchronously load the movie data from the 
specified URL. Upon successful loading, the drawTreeMap function is called to render the
 TreeMap.
