This repository features a collection of interactive data visualizations created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the D3.js library. Each project highlights different types of visualizations and interactive features, utilizing various datasets to enhance user experience.

## Bar Chart
The Bar Chart visualization displays GDP values over time. Utilizing D3.js, it creates an interactive bar chart with dynamic tooltips showing additional information on hover. The dataset used includes sample GDP data for different dates, with the chart styled for clarity and appeal.

## Choropleth Map
The Choropleth Map visualizes county-level education data, representing the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher. D3.js is used to generate an interactive map with color coding for different counties. The dataset includes county and education data, fetched from external sources.

## Heat Map
The Heat Map represents global land-surface temperatures from 1753 to 2015. This interactive visualization uses D3.js to display temperature variance with color coding. The dataset consists of global temperature data, and the map includes axes and tooltips to aid interpretation.

## Scatterplot
The Scatterplot visualizes cyclist data, including race times and doping allegations. D3.js is used to create an interactive scatter plot, mapping data points and generating axes. The dataset provides information on cyclists' performance and allegations, enhancing the visualization's interactivity.

## TreeMap
The TreeMap visualization displays movie data with rectangles sized and colored based on revenue. Created with D3.js, the interactive TreeMap features tooltips with additional movie information. The dataset includes movie names, categories, and revenue values, providing a detailed view of the data.
