Using Html,Css and JS(d3)


The provided code sets up an interactive bar chart using D3.js, a JavaScript library for 
manipulating documents based on data. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

HTML Structure:
The HTML file defines the basic structure of the document, includes a title, and links external styles and
 scripts.

Sample Data:
An array (data) with sample data representing GDP values for different dates.
Chart Dimensions:
Defines the width, height, and margins for the chart.

SVG Container:
Appends an SVG element to the HTML document, creating a container for the chart with proper dimensions and 
margins.

Scales:
Defines scales for the x-axis (xScale) and y-axis (yScale) based on the sample data.

Axes:
Creates x-axis and y-axis with corresponding scales and appends them to the SVG container.

Bars:
Binds the sample data to rectangles (bars) within the SVG container.
Sets attributes such as position, width, and height based on the data.
Adds a class ("bar") for styling purposes.
Defines mouseover and mouseout event listeners for interactivity.

Tooltip:
Creates a tooltip div element that will be used to display additional information when hovering over a bar.
Sets initial styles and opacity.

Mouseover and Mouseout Event Handlers:
handleMouseOver: Displays the tooltip with information about the date and GDP when a bar is hovered.
handleMouseOut: Hides the tooltip when the mouse moves away from a bar.

CSS Styling:
Styles the chart container, bars, and tooltip to enhance the visual presentation and interaction.
Specifies a hover effect for the bars.
In summary, this code generates a bar chart with D3.js, displaying GDP values over different dates. The 
chart is interactive, with tooltips showing additional information on hover, and it is styled for a 
visually appealing presentation.
