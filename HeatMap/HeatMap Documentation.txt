Heatmap Visualisation  with Html,Css and JS(d3)
By Nhlapo Nkululeko

 The code uses D3.js to create a heat map that visually represents global land-surface temperatures over 
 time, with interactive features such as tooltips and axes for better interpretation. The temperature 
 variance is categorized by color, and the visualization provides insights into temperature patterns from 
 1753 to 2015. Html and Css are also leveraged to lay foundation for the date, and customize it.

 
 Here's a high-level description of what each part of the code does:

Data Retrieval:
The URL of a JSON file containing global temperature data is defined (url).
An XMLHttpRequest (req) is created to asynchronously fetch the data.

Data Variables:
Variables (baseTemp and values) are declared to store the base temperature and an array of temperature 
variance values.

SVG and Scales Setup:
D3.js is used to select the SVG element and tooltip.
Scales (xScale and yScale) are generated based on the data, mapping years to the x-axis and months to the 
y-axis.

Drawing the Board:
The SVG dimensions are set based on predefined values (width, height) using D3.

Drawing Cells (Rectangles):
Rectangles are appended to the SVG based on the temperature variance data.
The color of each rectangle represents the temperature variance category.
Data attributes and event listeners are added for interactivity.


Generating Axes:
X and Y axes are generated using D3, with tick formatting for better readability.
The axes are appended to the SVG.

Data Loading and Visualization:
The XMLHttpRequest is configured to fetch the JSON data asynchronously.
Upon loading, the JSON data is parsed, and the base temperature and variance values are stored.
The console logs the base temperature and variance values.
Functions to draw the board, generate scales, draw cells, and generate axes are called to visualize the 
data.
